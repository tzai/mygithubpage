## About
What came first: the software developer or the hardware designer? For me, it was the former, but when I realized the physical limitations of writing code, I decided to branch out my skills.

Software:
Highly proficient in C, embedded C, C++, C#, Java and Python. Have experience with many more. Throw any new language at me and I will learn it.

Hardware:
Schematic capture and layout experience in Altium, EAGLE and Cadence. Have designed and assembled numerous PCBs from start to finish. Not afraid of surface-mount components, and can solder anything down to 0402.

Firmware:
Experience with many ARM-based microcontrollers from vendors such as TI, Microchip, and Freescale (now NXP). Comfortable with respective vendor IDEs, such as Code Composer Studio, CodeWarrior, and MPLAB X. Have developed firmware for a wide range of applications, including remote flight control for quadcopters and real-time data acquisition in an automotive environment.
